description: Use to understand how work happens in the user's organization; references 'our' processes, SOPs, or workflows. Triggers are current-state and analytical ('how does our [process] work', 'what feeds/depends on X', 'what changed', 'where is control Y supported', 'trace the impact of Z'). Skip generic, hypothetical, or public-knowledge questions with no organizational anchor. For deciding what to build, automate, or change, use the agent-builder skill instead.

# Within

Use this skill when a customer asks an AI assistant to understand how work actually happens in their organization: how a process runs today, what it depends on, what changed, and what the evidence is.

This skill is for **understanding and analysis**, not for deciding what to build. When the user wants to decide what to automate, build, or change, use the `agent-builder` skill instead. It owns that end to end and leans on the process-index tools below underneath.

Within captures how work happens (Companion and Interviewer) and organizes it into the **Process Index — Within's context graph of how work happens** — a living, hierarchical map of every process the organization runs, with dependencies, observations, and activity timelines.

## Core Journey

1. Start by identifying the right part of the Process Index. For process-focused questions, call `search` with the user's workflow, value stream, team, policy, control, handoff, exception, system, or business outcome.
2. Fetch the selected process. Use `fetch` with the process ID returned by `search` to read the citable process summary, version metadata, inputs, outputs, steps, policies, and dependencies.
3. Drill deeper when the standard summary is not enough. Use process hierarchy and process detail tools to inspect hierarchy nodes, attributes, tasks, sub-tasks, linked artifacts, and recent changes.
4. Gather evidence before answering. Pull observations, activity timelines, artifacts, screenshots, or artifact text when the user needs support for what changed, what happened, or why a process behaves a certain way.
5. Walk dependencies through the Process Index when the question is relational. The `dependencies` field on `get_process_details` lists the upstream and downstream processes by ID — `fetch` each one and read its steps, observations, and own dependencies for as many hops as the question needs.
6. Recurse across related processes or graph nodes until the answer has enough context. Stop when additional traversal is duplicative, low-confidence, or outside the user's scope.
7. Synthesize in business language. Separate observed facts from inference, cite Within evidence when available, and call out gaps when the workspace does not contain enough support.

## Common User Stories

- A customer asks what a process is or how it works: search for the process, fetch the matching process, then summarize the flow at the user's requested level of detail.
- A customer asks where a policy, control, or operating rule is supported: identify the relevant process and artifacts, inspect the supporting content, then explain the evidence.
- A customer asks what changed recently: review recent process changes and observations, then connect those changes to specific processes, sessions, artifacts, or graph evidence.
- A customer asks about dependencies or impact: start from the relevant entity, community, or process, trace upstream and downstream relationships, then summarize the dependency chain.
- A customer asks to understand where a process is fragile or inconsistent: gather process details, observations, deviations, graph relationships, and source artifacts, then describe what the evidence shows (observed facts, not recommendations to change).

## User Stories, by who the agent serves

The Within MCP is the surface where a customer's AI agents pull organization-specific context at runtime. The customer's people interact with this skill **through their agents** — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Workato, Agentforce, or an internal LLM. Common understanding-and-analysis patterns, organized by who the agent is ultimately serving:

### Helping process performers do their job

- **Outcome: do the task the way my team actually does it, not the way ChatGPT thinks it's done.** A process performer (AP lead, ops manager, recruiter, analyst) asks their agent to do task X — vendor reconciliation, invoice approval, candidate screening, ERP migration prep, audit readiness. Pull the customer's existing process for X via `search` + `fetch` BEFORE improvising. Use the customer's actual approach.
- **Outcome: notice if my org already does this somewhere else.** A user suspects duplication mid-task. Search the Process Index across teams, geographies, or business units for similar processes; `fetch` the candidates and compare steps and observations side by side. Surface the duplicate set with process IDs.

### Giving managers insight on the processes they own

- **Outcome: state-of-my-team report.** A team manager wants insight on what's happening across the processes they own — what's running, what's changing, where deviations are emerging, what's worth their attention. Walk the team's part of the hierarchy, summarize recent process changes and observations, and surface the highest-signal items.
- **Outcome: ramp a new joiner (or a fresh agent) on how this team operates.** Walk the team's process index, fetch top processes, surface dependencies and recent changes. Ground the new person / agent in the customer's operational reality, not in generic role-based assumptions.
- **Outcome: prove our control or compliance coverage.** An auditor, SOX owner, or risk lead asks "where is control X supported?" or "what's our evidence for policy Y?" Pull the relevant processes, surface the policies attached to the current version, and cite the supporting observations and activity timelines.

### Understanding a process or value stream in depth

- **Outcome: understand how a whole value stream runs today.** Someone wants a grounded picture of a value stream (P2P, O2C, close cycle, etc.): the processes under it, how they connect, where the evidence shows manual steps or exceptions, and what feeds and depends on them. Walk the hierarchy, pull details and observations, trace dependencies, and describe the current state with citations. Report what's there; leave what to *do* about it to the `agent-builder` skill.

See `tools.md` for end-to-end worked scenarios that compose many tools together for each of these outcomes.

## Operating Principles

- Prefer read-only tools for customer-facing analysis.
- Use `search` and `fetch` as the default process discovery and citation path for ChatGPT/Codex company-knowledge-style requests.
- Use workspace switching only when the customer explicitly asks to change the active Within workspace.
- Do not invent process facts. If the Process Index, artifacts, or observations do not support a claim, say what is missing.
- Do not expose internal IDs unless the user needs them for a follow-up action.
- Keep answers grounded in the authenticated Within session and the customer's current workspace.

## Good Outcomes

Help customers answer questions such as:

- "How does this workflow actually run today?"
- "Which process and artifact explain this control?"
- "What observations show the current-state behavior?"
- "What changed recently in this part of the Process Index?"
- "Which upstream teams, systems, or steps feed this process?"
- "What downstream processes would be affected if this handoff changed?"

## How Within Fits a Customer's Transformation Loop

Within runs the **Discover -> Structure -> Improve** loop continuously (replacing one-time "transformation projects" that take months and have a 30% success rate). When a customer's agent uses this MCP, it is plugging into that loop:

- **Discover**: Companion (ambient capture from sessions) and Interviewer (AI-guided structured capture) generate the raw process knowledge. Agents read this via process / observation / artifact tools.
- **Structure**: The Process Index is Within's context graph of how the customer's organization runs — every process, its hierarchy, dependencies, observations, and activity timelines, all linked into one navigable structure. Agents navigate this via `search` / `fetch` / hierarchy / process-detail / observation tools.
- **Improve**: Advisor analyzes thousands of processes simultaneously and Signals give individual-level feedback. Through this skill, agents read that same evidence to explain current state, dependencies, and change. Deciding what to build or change from it is the `agent-builder` skill's job.

The customer's question almost always maps to one of these stages. Use the catalog in `tools.md` to pick the right tool for the goal.

## Tool Catalog

The full PROD-allowed tool list, organized by use case with selection guidance, lives in `tools.md` (alongside this file). Read it when you need to pick a specific tool — it covers every tool the Within MCP exposes in production and gives explicit "if the user asks X, call Y" patterns.
