# Klarity MCP — PROD Tool Catalog

This is the operational reference for every tool the Klarity MCP exposes to a
customer's AI agent in production. **All tools here are read-only** — the MCP
never mutates workspace state.

The point of this catalog is not to enumerate APIs — it's to help an agent
**pick the right tool for the goal at hand** when working inside a customer's
Klarity workspace.

## How agents should think about Klarity

Klarity is a process intelligence platform that captures **how work
actually happens** inside a customer's organization (Companion + Interviewer),
organizes it into a living **Process Index — Klarity's context graph of how
work happens** (Structure), and helps customers improve via Advisor + Signals
(Improve). When an agent calls the Klarity MCP, it is reading from that living
map.

The agent's job is usually one of:

1. **Understand current state** — what process exists, who runs it, how, with
   what evidence.
2. **Explain or summarize** — answer a customer question grounded in the
   workspace, not generic knowledge.
3. **Trace dependencies / impact** — what feeds this, what is downstream, what
   breaks if it changes.
4. **Find improvement opportunities** — surface duplication, exceptions,
   inconsistencies across processes that humans miss at scale.
5. **Drive transformation** — pull the evidence needed to plan a future state
   (ERP migration, automation, controls coverage, close-cycle reduction, etc.).

All five workflows reduce to: **find the right process(es) → fetch detail →
gather evidence → traverse relationships → synthesize**. The tools below are
grouped by where they fit in that flow.

---

## A. Standard MCP entry points

The default entry path. Most ChatGPT / Claude / standard MCP clients will start
here.

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `search` | First call for almost any process question. Semantic search over the customer's process index. **Iterate** — single queries rarely cover broad topics, and processes use organization-specific names. |
| `fetch` | Pull full details for one process by ID returned from `search` or hierarchy navigation: placement in the index, current version (steps, policies, inputs/outputs), dependencies, history. Fetch dependency IDs to walk relationships. |

---

## B. Process Index — discover & navigate

Use these when `search` results feel sparse, or when you need richer process
metadata than `fetch` returns.

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `search_processes` | Search processes by name, objective, team, or semantic similarity — ranked keyword + semantic results. Use for an exact phrase or team filter as well as broad topic search. |
| `get_process_hierarchy` | Browse the whole index tree structure (nodes with name, type, children). Use when search misses, or to orient before drilling in. Supports `max_depth` / `root`. |
| `get_hierarchy_node_details` | Inspect a single hierarchy node — parent, children, linked process. |
| `get_process_details` | The rich nested payload: `current_version`, `dependencies`, `hierarchy_node`, optional version history. This is what `fetch` reshapes. Use directly when you need the structured shape, or narrow with `scope` (any of `attributes`, `tasks`, `observations`, `dependencies`, `linked_artifacts`, `policies`, `history`; defaults to `attributes`). |

---

## C. Process change & evidence

Customer asks "what changed?", "what happened?", "why does this run this way?"
Use these to pull the evidence trail behind a process.

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `get_recent_process_changes` | Workspace-wide version-change feed. "What has been edited recently?" |
| `get_process_observations` | Recorded executions of one process, surfacing the friction signals (deviations / exceptions captured by Companion). `verbosity="summary"` to scan; `verbosity="full"` for the narrative. Optional version filter. |
| `get_observation_citation` | The actual session timeline behind an observation: what the user did, when. The most "primary source" evidence Klarity has. Only works for your own sessions. |

---

## D. Artifacts — the source evidence

Artifacts are the underlying documents, recordings, and source files behind
processes (BRDs, SOPs, recordings).

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `search_artifacts` | Hybrid semantic + lexical search across artifact text chunks. Returns short snippets. **Start here** for artifact discovery. |
| `get_artifact_details` | Artifact metadata and relationships. |
| `get_artifact_content` | Artifact text — `mode="preview"` for the first ~15k tokens, or `mode="range"` with `start_line` / `end_line` for numbered lines (~5k-token cap) when you need to cite specific lines. |
| `search_artifact_text` | Within one artifact (by `resource_key`), find matches with surrounding context. |

---

## E. Workspace navigation

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `list_accessible_workspaces` | List the customer's workspaces and which one is currently active. |

The connection is scoped to a single workspace. Switching workspace is an
auth-level action (reconnect via OAuth, or use a key generated in the other
workspace), not something the agent does at runtime.

---

## F. Sessions

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `list_sessions` | Recent workspace sessions as supporting evidence — the processes each updated, its duration, and who created it. |

---

## Tool-selection patterns by goal

**"Tell me about process X"** → `search` → `fetch`. If sparse: `get_process_hierarchy` to browse, then `fetch` the right leaf.

**"What is the evidence for Y?"** → `fetch` (process) → look at policies in current_version + observations → `get_observation_citation` for the actual session that produced an observation.

**"What changed recently?"** → `get_recent_process_changes` → drill into specific processes via `fetch`, then `get_process_observations` for the deviation detail.

**"What depends on Z?" / "What is the impact?"** → `search` for Z → `fetch` + `get_process_details` to read its `dependencies` field → `fetch` each upstream and downstream process to walk the chain. For impact-critical answers, also pull observations on the dependents.

**"Find improvement opportunities in our P2P value stream"** → `get_process_hierarchy` (root: P2P node) → for each leaf: `get_process_details` → look for duplication, exception handling, missing controls. Surface as a ranked candidate set with evidence.

---

## Operating principles for agents

1. **Iterate on search.** Single queries miss. Always be willing to refine 2–4
   times before falling back to hierarchy browsing.
2. **Stay grounded.** Cite Klarity evidence when available (process IDs,
   artifact IDs, observation timestamps). Do not invent facts the workspace
   does not support.
3. **Separate observed from inferred.** "Observed: X happens at step 3."
   "Inferred: this is likely a duplication of Y based on similar steps in Z."
4. **Call out gaps.** If the workspace does not have evidence, say so plainly.
   That gap is itself useful information for the customer.
5. **Do not expose internal IDs unless needed for a follow-up.** Resource keys
   are for tool calls, not user-facing prose.
6. **Read-only.** Every PROD tool is read-only; the MCP never mutates
   workspace state.

## Worked end-to-end scenarios

Each scenario starts with the **outcome** the agent is trying to achieve, then
shows how to compose tools to get there. Use these as recipes — adapt the
exact sequence to the customer's specific question.

### Scenario 1 — Help a process performer do their job (the customer's actual way)

**Outcome:** "Help me do this task the way my team actually does it, not the
way ChatGPT thinks it's done."

A process performer (AP lead, ops manager, recruiter, analyst) has asked
their agent to do real work — vendor reconciliation, invoice approval, ERP
migration prep, audit walkthrough. Pull the customer's existing process
before improvising.

1. `list_accessible_workspaces` — confirm the agent is in the right
   workspace (if not, the user must reconnect to switch — the agent can't).
2. `search` — query the task in the user's words ("vendor invoice
   reconciliation"). Iterate 2–4 times with refined queries — single queries
   rarely cover broad topics.
3. If still sparse: `get_process_hierarchy` — orient on the value
   stream (P2P, O2C, close cycle, etc.) and find the right leaf.
4. `fetch` — pull the matched process. Read steps, policies, inputs,
   outputs, and dependencies.
5. `get_process_details` — go deeper if `fetch`'s shape is not enough
   (e.g., need the full version metadata or all dependency IDs to walk).
6. `get_process_observations` — exception patterns observed for this
   process across versions; surface new edge cases the user should know about.
7. `get_observation_citation` — drill into the most recent or
   most relevant exception session for primary-source evidence of how the
   process actually runs in practice.
8. Optional: read the `dependencies` field already in `get_process_details`,
   and `fetch` an upstream or downstream process if the user's task touches
   the boundary (e.g., "what should I check before I close this out?").
9. Synthesize: "Here's how your team does this, here's the deviation
   pattern from last quarter, here's what to watch for."

### Scenario 2 — Give a manager a state-of-the-team report

**Outcome:** "Give me a state-of-the-team report on the processes we own —
what's running, what's changing, what's deviating, what needs my attention."

A team manager is checking in on the processes their team owns. The agent
should produce a concise, evidence-backed brief that the manager can act on.

1. `list_accessible_workspaces` — confirm workspace.
2. `get_process_hierarchy` (root: their team's value stream node) —
   pull the team's part of the index.
3. `get_recent_process_changes` — what's been edited recently across the
   workspace, filtered to processes under the team's tree.
4. For each high-volume or recently-changed process:
   - `get_process_details` — current state, dependencies, version label.
   - `get_process_observations` (`verbosity="summary"`) — recent
     observation summary and emerging deviation patterns.
5. Spot-check the top 2–3 emerging deviations:
   `get_observation_citation` — drill into the actual session
   for primary-source detail.
6. Synthesize: "Your team owns N processes. M changed in the last 30
   days. K are showing deviation patterns worth your attention. Here are
   the top 3 with evidence."

### Scenario 3 — Find transformation opportunities across the process index

**Outcome:** "Find me the highest-leverage transformation / automation
opportunities across our org (or this value stream). Where should we focus?"

A platform lead, AI transformation owner, or AI architect needs a ranked
candidate set. This is the "spin up multiple agents to scan the entire
process tree" use case — agents should fan out in parallel across the
hierarchy.

1. `list_accessible_workspaces` — confirm workspace.
2. `get_process_hierarchy` — pull the whole tree, or filter to the
   value stream of interest. This becomes the work queue.
3. **In parallel** across leaves (this is where multiple agents pay off):
   - `get_process_details` — current version, steps, dependencies.
     Note step count, manual vs system steps, exception count.
   - `get_process_observations` (`verbosity="summary"`) — exception
     volume per process.
4. `search` directly on the index for high-leverage patterns: "manual
   approval", "duplicate entry", "data re-keying", "exception handling",
   "swivel-chair workflow". `fetch` each hit to confirm the pattern is
   real, not just a name match.
5. For each top candidate:
   - `get_process_observations` — confirm the deviation/manual pattern
     with concrete evidence.
   - Read the `dependencies` field already returned by
     `get_process_details` for a first cut at blast radius.
6. Synthesize a ranked candidate set: process IDs, observation counts,
   dependency depth, similarity to known patterns, evidence trail.

### Scenario 4 — Form a transformation thesis on a chosen process or value stream

**Outcome:** "I've zeroed in on process X (or value stream Y). Build me a
transformation thesis: current state, blast radius, dependencies, where to
intervene."

The customer has identified the target. The agent's job is to build deep,
evidence-grounded understanding before recommending changes.

1. `list_accessible_workspaces` — confirm workspace.
2. `search` → `fetch` (or directly `fetch` if the ID is known) — pull
   the target process.
3. `get_process_details` — full nested payload: current version, all
   dependencies, hierarchy node, version history.
4. `get_hierarchy_node_details` — context within the index
   (parent value stream, sibling processes that may share patterns).
5. `get_recent_process_changes` (filtered to this process if possible)
   — version evolution. What has the team been changing? In which
   direction?
6. `get_process_observations` — all observations across versions. Look
   for repeated deviation patterns, exception types, manual workarounds.
7. For 3–5 representative observations:
   `get_observation_citation` — primary-source detail of how
   the process runs in practice (not how it's documented).
8. **Walk the dependency graph in the index.** The `dependencies` field
   already in `get_process_details` lists upstream and downstream
   processes by ID. For each, `fetch` + `get_process_details`. Read
   their steps, their own dependencies, and their recent observations.
   Repeat for as many hops as the thesis needs.
   - **Upstream:** what feeds this. Root cause / input quality matters
     for transformation viability.
   - **Downstream:** blast radius if we change it. Surfacing this early
     prevents under-scoped transformation proposals.
   - For the most-affected dependencies, drill one level deeper:
     `get_process_observations` and `get_observation_citation`.
9. **Cross-check sibling processes.** From the
   `get_hierarchy_node_details` payload returned earlier,
   `fetch` two or three sibling processes under the same value stream.
   If they share patterns, controls, or systems with the target, the
   transformation thesis may need to address them too.
10. Synthesize a transformation thesis:
    - **Current state:** how the process actually runs (cite
      observations).
    - **Blast radius:** upstream feeders + downstream dependents.
    - **Pain pattern:** the deviation / manual / duplication signal,
      with evidence.
    - **Intervention points:** where to change, ranked by leverage and
      risk.
    - **Open questions:** what evidence is missing that would
      strengthen or invalidate the thesis.

### What these scenarios share

- **Iteration is normal.** Every scenario uses 2–4 search refinements before
  drilling. Don't bail after one query.
- **Composition is the value.** No single tool answers a real question. The
  agent's job is to chain reads — search → process → version → observation
  → activity timeline → dependencies → sibling processes — until it has
  enough to answer with confidence.
- **Always ground synthesis.** Cite process IDs and observation timestamps.
  Never invent.
- **Parallelize on transformation scans.** Scenario 3 explicitly benefits
  from multiple agents fanning out across the hierarchy. The MCP is
  stateless per call — there's no penalty for parallel reads.
